# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Console OOP based Tic Tac Toe game with Artificial Intelligence that never loses. Here, I use Minimax Algorithm to determine the best move for the AI player so that it never loses, either it win or there will be a tie. For a complete discussion about minimax algorithm please take a look at <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/">here</a>

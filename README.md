# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Console OOP based Tic Tac Toe game with Artificial Intelligence that never loses. Here, I use Minimax Algorithm to determine the best move for the AI player so that it never loses, either it win or there will be a tie. 

For a complete discussion about minimax algorithm please take a look at--
